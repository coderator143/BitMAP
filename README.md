# BITMAP

Basically it's a map of BIT Mesra and surrounding areas. Every place of our college is not on GoogleMaps, so we decided to make a local
app for especially BIT students. Enabling navigation is still at work,so please don't mind!

## Features

1) Tracking of current location and GPS detection.
2) Redirecting to your current location on a single click.
3) Search any place of interest or nearby place in BIT Mesra.
4) An interactive 3D and 2D view, with options allowing you to switch between night and day mode.
5) Markers appearing on different zoom level to help you know the place you're at.
6) A menu allowing you to show all hostels, academic places etc.
7) A single tap hides the markers.

## Getting started

You can clone the project or download the ZIP folder.

### Prerequisites

```
Android Studio 3.0 or higher
Git 1.8.5.6 or higher
A little knowledge of JAVA!
```

## Built With

Android Studio

### API Reference

```
Google Maps SDK
Places API
Directions API
```

## Minor Bugs & Other Info

1) Sometimes while searching for a place, the red marker indicating the place does not appear but the camera zooms to the exact location. 
2) To know your exact location within 100m radius, you first have to switch on your GPS. By not doing so, a red cross marker pops on the screen.
3) Make sure to grant the app all the permisssions it asks for, otherwise it may crash.
4) Tap on a marker to know the place name.
5) You can add custom markers by tapping and holding.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Stack overflow, Google itself and youtube channels(Coding with Mitch). And obviously, the Google API's made this 
work a hell lot easier. Also special thanks to Shubham Sawlani for his valuable suggestions.
